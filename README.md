# CompGIFConverter
A program to convert Infernum's .compgif files to .gif files.

## What are compgif files?
These are compressed gif files used by Infernum to store in-game footage to then display during the mod's credit sequence.

## How to use
Download the latest release, and extract the files to a new folder. Drag any compgif files you wish to convert into the same folder. These can be found at: ``EDocuments\My Games\Terraria\tModLoader\BossFootage``, inside the player named folders. Run the exe file, and the program will create playable GIF files from any valid compgifs.
